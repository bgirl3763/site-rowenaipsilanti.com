In this project, we designed an addition to an existing shopping mall in the city of Palembang, Indonesia. The addition is much larger than the existing mall and accommodates high-class entertainment center. The design adopts the “Super-Block” concept and Green design with a wide variety of programs and green parks on each level. The challenge of the design is to keep the existing sport center at the center of the shopping mall visible and exposed to the street, but can still utilize as much land as possible for commercial development.
