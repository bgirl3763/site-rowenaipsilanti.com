New Road is a fictional non-profit organization that I established, with a focus to work on policy-making project that is designed to improve existing transportation systems to achieve sustainability goals, which include reducing transportation impacts on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Jakarta was selected as the initial site to start develop a method of solution for a balanced transportation system, with consideration of its complex transportation problems. You can view & download the booklet with the detailed strategies on https://goo.gl/PeJDWY or drop me an email. Note that this project was based on cases and conditions in 2014.
