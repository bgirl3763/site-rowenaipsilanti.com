This project asked to design a museum on an existing parking lot site in the Pittsburgh Strip District. The idea is about archiving as much types of events (objects, performances, and moment) as possible. In order to achieve this objective, the building design used the concept of inflatability of a balloon, in which different programs can be loaded into and taken out from the building. The plans, sections, and the massing studies focused on the initial partis, which are characterized with diagonal grains on the plan to utilize the corner condition of the site and a stack of undulating surfaces in the section which are connected together and create a variation of voids that can hold changing programs.
