Building up my deep interest in the “Layering of Views” in the precedent Glass House by Philip Johnson through my series of analysis of the house, this project is a total adoption of and a new design built upon the past.
My analysis of light and layering of views in the Glass House was being taken further into designing a new architecture that incorporates both the ideas of light, reflection and transparencies of glass to create a layering of spaces.
This project has an objective to rearrange previous conceptions in the service of originating new ones.
