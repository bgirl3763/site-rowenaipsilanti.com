Situated between major urban spaces, the NEXUS acts as a link between Chicago and Toronto, New Center and Detroit and within the site.  It utilizes the transit hub as the center and nexus between the regions as a catalyst and stem for people to connect with each other.
The NEXUS is designed for pedestrian friendly walkways and transportation centers for commuters, residents and visitors. Reacting to the existing site conditions, the NEXUS creates a flow within the block for pedestrians and cyclists.  Through a meandering central axis, the architecture curves to suggest a flow around the site and the spaces in and around buildings.  The street side is perforated with entrances that welcome pedestrians into the spaces within.
