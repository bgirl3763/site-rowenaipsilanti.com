In this project, I designed an apartment together with my team intended mainly for, but not restricted to students. Strategically located near two known public institutions/universities, the apartment is designed to be simple and modern. It has two towers and features vast natural and man-made green environments to promote its function as a living and study space for a diverse range of students. The front tower is more exclusive and upclass. Facilities include infinite and lagoon pools, with pool side cafe and cafetaria facing the valley at the back of the structures, gym, courts, and shops to accommodate the needs of its users.
