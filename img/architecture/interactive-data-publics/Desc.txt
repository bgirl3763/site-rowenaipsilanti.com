My thesis project recombines existing lifestyle and demographic data of Clevelandâ€™s neighborhoods in order to image the potential for latent and vital collectives to emerge through architectural interventions. Information generated through this data mapping is a powerful way to define new publics and suitable spots for connecting and activating challenging points in the city, which have mixed urban issues of diversity, population decline, and high crime rate. With this generative intention, the interventions are designed to be flexible, mobile, and contradicting to initiate a broad range of responses from the city collectives. The interventions are evocative and iconic objects, taking on the literal form of data patterns, and maintaining a loop connection between the initial data and its open-end translation. They are designed with programs that support and also refute the interpretation of existing data.
