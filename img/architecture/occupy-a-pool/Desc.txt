This project is about re-programming an interior test site that is paired with a modeling technique focusing the design efforts through a particular approach to material and spatial concerns, leaving room for individual translation and invention in support of my design concepts. The site is an olympic pool in the Central Campus Recreation Building located in Ann Arbor, MI, and I re-programmed the space to accommodate a performance in the space. The pool is flipped vertically and floating above the emptied original pool, which now functions as a performance space. The wall of the new pool was a cast of rockite and the water was represented by casted soap which allows light to penetrate through.
