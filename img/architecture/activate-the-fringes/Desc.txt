My team of three was selected to represent the University of Michigan in the 2014 Vertical Cities Asia Competition that was held in Singapore (published on http://verticalcitiesasia.com/?q=archive/2014). The competition site was located in Mumbai, India, in which the challenge was to deal with the issues of urban connectivity. During our visit to Mumbai, we identified critical problems such as limited space and access to resources, informal settlement, and were interested in how culture plays a big role in the local society. We started from small-scale strategy through designing housing for 100,000 people on the site, then progressed to larger-scale strategies, which are to connect to fishing as the major economies and water transport, connect through flexible housing, and connect through water conservation.
