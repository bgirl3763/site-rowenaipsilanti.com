INTERACTIVE DATA PUBLICS

This thesis recombines existing lifestyle and demographic data of Cleveland’s neighborhoods in order to image the potential for latent and vital collectives to emerge through architectural interventions. The visual representation of this combination of existing lifestyle and demographic data through patterns serves to generate a matrix of speculative information about public interests in Cleveland. This generated information is a powerful way to define new publics and suitable spots for connecting and activating challenging points in the city, which have mixed urban issues of diversity, population decline, and high crime rate.

The representation of existing data is translated into architectural interventions that continue to trigger the emergence of new collectives. With this intention, the interventions are designed to be flexible, mobile, and contradicting to initiate a broad range of responses from the city collectives and potentially generate new publics. The architectural interventions are evocative and iconic objects, taking on the literal form of data patterns, and maintaining a loop connection between the initial data and its open-end translation. They are designed with programs that support and also refute the interpretation of existing data.
